    "\n",
    "Postman is a GUI application for sending requests to a server, and can be useful to help visualize the way the requests are sent and responses handled. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.getpostman.com/). To begin, you will need to obtain an authorization token by sending a POST request with your email address and password. First, next to the URL bar, change the dropdown from GET to POST and enter https://[BACKEND_URL]/api-token-auth/ into the URL bar. Then, in the Headers tab, add a key: \"Content-Type\" and a value: \"application/json\" as shown in the screenshot below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Postman Auth Header](./images/postman-auth-header.PNG)\n",

    "\n",
    "![Postman Auth Body](./images/postman-auth-body.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hit the blue Send button to send the request. When the response is returned, you should see a single key-value pair in the response body area. The value is a long string of characters and that is your authorization token:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Postman Auth Token](./images/postman-auth-token.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this token, create a new request and this time, add a header with the key \"Authorization\" and the value \"JWT token_value\" where token_value is the string from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Postman Token](./images/postman-token.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will then get a specific image from the MIBItracker. The route for retrieving a specific image is `TRACKER_BACKEND_URL/images/[id]`, where 'id' is the primary key of the image. For example, to retrieve the image with id = 429, enter the formatted URL into the URL bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Postman Images Retrieve](./images/postman-images-retrieve.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a JSON object containing the properties of the image. As you can see from the first key, it has an id of 429, which is the id we used in the example URL above.\n",
